# What is Sonar?

Sonar is a web based code quality analysis tool for Maven based Java projects. It covers a wide area of code quality check points which include: Architecture & Design, Complexity, Duplications, Coding Rules, Potential Bugs, Unit Test etc. Sonar has a rich set of features like what you would get with different tools such as Covertura, PMD, FindBugs, Check Styles combined.

# Getting started

## Using sonarqube-postgres

Simply run `docker-compose up -d` and go to `http:localhost:9000`.
Wait some seconds until Sonar is ready, and log with `admin` password `admin`, and skip the tutorial.

> Note that you will need a file to config sonar-runner, that file is `sonar-runner.properties`, there is all configs to perform you code analysis. See the example file and sample code for more information.
